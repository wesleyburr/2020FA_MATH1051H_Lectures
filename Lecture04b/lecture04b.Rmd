# Examining Numerical Data

## Scatterplots

Let's look at Gapminder briefly (link on Blackboard) and chat about scatterplots.

## Histograms $-$ Extracurricular Hours

* Histograms provide a view of the **data density**. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.
* Histograms are especially convenient for describing the **shape** of the data distribution.
* The chosen **bin width** can alter the story the histogram is telling.

<div style="float:center; position:relative; left:250px; top:-10px;">
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_1_6_hist.png")
```
</div>

## Essay on Histograms

Let's look at an interactive essay on histograms made by a colleague in Minnesota.

# Statistics

## 1. Sample Mean

The average, you've done it before.

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

## 2. Sample Median

The median is the value that splits the data in half when ordered in ascending order.

<center>
```{r, out.width = "150px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_1_6_median1.png")
```
</center>

If there are an even number of observations, then the median is the average of the two values in the middle.

<center>
```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fig_1_6_median2.png")
```
</center>
Since the median is the midpoint of the data, 50% of the values are below it. Hence, it is also the 50th **percentile**.

## 3. Variance

**Variance** is roughly the average squared deviation from the mean.

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$
Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?

* To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
* To weigh larger deviations more heavily.

## 4. Standard Deviation

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance, and has the same units as the data.

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

## Percentile

A **percentile** is the the smallest value from an ordered list of numbers which is greater than or equal to that percentage of list elements.

**Example**: The $42^\text{nd}$ percentile of the numbers $\{ 1, 2, 3, \cdots, 99, 100 \}$ is 42.

It can become quite complicated when there aren't an even multiple of 100 items!

## 5-7. Q1, Q3 and IQR

* The 25th percentile is also called the first quartile, **Q1**.
* The 50th percentile is also called the median.
* The 75th percentile is also called the third quartile, **Q3**.

Between Q1 and Q3 is the middle 50% of the data. The range these data span is called the **interquartile range**, or the IQR.

$$
\text{IQR} = \text{Q3} - \text{Q1}
$$


## Calculating

I will never expect you to compute a variance or SD without a calculator. In practice, we do this using
R always. For example,

```{r}
x <- sample(1:100, size = 20, replace = TRUE)
mean(x)
median(x)
```

## Calculating

```{r}
var(x)
sd(x)
sqrt(var(x))
```

## Calculating

```{r}
quantile(x, probs = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75))
summary(x)
```
