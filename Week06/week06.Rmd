# Week 06

## What's Available

I'm regularly getting questions from students who don't appear to know what's
actually being posted to Blackboard. So here's a summary:

* every lecture: Friday asynch videos, Monday asynch videos, and
recordings of the Tuesday live session (3-5pm)
* every workshop: both a "main copy" (with Prof Burr talking to the TAs as if they
were the students, and he were the TA), and recordings of live sessions with TAs
Sophie and Skye, so you can get a feel for a "real workshop" session
* extras videos on technical issues - and problem solving (including binomials!)
* these weekly reminders

**Please** go into Course Content, and explore. I update the folders with new videos
every two days or so (Monday mornings, Tuesday evenings, Wednesday evenings, Thursday
morning, and Friday morning).

## Microsoft Teams

There are still folks joining Microsoft Teams regularly - this really is where you should
be going to get help! We have a great set of TAs, and there is an office hour every single
morning and afternoon all week - drop in to Zoom, ask questions, get help with your 
assignments.

## Schedule

* Friday 16th - 11th lecture (intro to scatterplots) posted
* Monday 19th - 12th lecture (scatterplots, linear models) posted
* Tuesday 20th - in-person overview of 12th lecture, plus commentary, Q&A
* Tuesday 20th / Wednesday 21st - 6th in-person workshop - binomial and normal

There is a PDF posted on Blackboard with full details of the first six weeks.
We'll be posting the second stretch of 6 weeks over Reading Week, so you can
similarly plan your life.

## To Do List

* finish WeBWorK Assignment #05 for Monday the 19th
* get caught up on lectures, watch Lecture 11 (today) and 12 (Monday the 19th) asynch version
